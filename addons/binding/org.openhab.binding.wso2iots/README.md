# WSO2 IoT Server Binding

This binding is used to connect with a locally hosted [WSO2 IoT Server 3.1.0](https://wso2.com/iot) and get temperature, humidity, light, motion data from the devices enrolled in the WSO2 IoTS building monitor plugin. The binding allows communication between the openHAB server and WSO2 IoT server.

[WSO2](https://wso2.com/) is an opensource middleware company and IoTS is one of the five products offered by the company.

To use the binding, first the user has to locally setup the [WSO2 IoTS](https://wso2.com/iot) and deploy the [building monitor plugin](https://github.com/wso2/samples-iots/tree/master/floor-analytics-demo). [The building monitor agent](https://github.com/wso2/samples-iots/tree/master/floor-analytics-demo/BuildingMonitorDevice) uses DHT 11, PIR SR501, LM393 sensors and ESP8266 12E module. 

After enrolling the device agent, an access token has to be obtained from [WSO2 API store](https://localhost:9443/api-store/).

Further details on how to configure this binding can be found [here](https://medium.com/@ramesha.karu/integrating-openhab2-with-wso2-iot-server-5fda14fd382e).

## Supported Things

There are two supported thing types: WSO2 IoT Server Bridge and Building monitor. Building monitor thing type represents one device agent. It has the `buildingMonitor` id. You can add multiple Things, e.g. Devices enrolled in different floors and different buildings.

## Discovery

There is no discovery implemented. You have to create your things manually.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at Thing level.

## Thing Configuration

The thing has the following configuration parameters:

Thing type: WSO2 IoT Server Bridge

| Parameter |                            Description                           |
|:---------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  hostname | Host name of the machine on which the WSO2 IoT server is running |
|    port   | Port to access WSO2 IoT Server                                   |
|  refresh  | Refresh interval in minutes. Minimum is 1 minute.                |


Thing type: Building Monitor


| Parameter |                                Description                                |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   apikey  | Access token to invoke the WSO2 IoTS API for building monitor. Mandatory. |
|  deviceId | Unique ID of the device agent                                             |
|  refresh  | Refresh interval in minutes. Optional, the default value is 60 minutes.   |

## Channels

The information that is retrieved is available as these channels:

|  Channel ID | Item Type | Description                                                                      |
|:-----------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    motion   |   Number  | Motion level in the range 0-1. 0 means no motion and 1 means high motion level   |
| temperature |   Number  | Temperature in Celsius degrees                                                   |
|    light    |   Number  | Light level in the range 0-1024. 0 mean high brightness and 1024 means very dark |
|   humidity  |   Number  | Humidity as a percentage                                                         |
